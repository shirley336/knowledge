# Eligibility to be a Customer
## Payment Transfer Activity Customer

An entity that is or is eligible to be a Principal, Affiliate, Association, or other entity that has been approved by the Corporation for Participation in a Payment Transfer Activity (PTA) Program and that satisfies such eligibility criteria as the Corporation may adopt from time to time, consistent with the promotion of safe and sound business practices, may apply to be a PTA Customer. No entity may Participate in a PTA Program as a PTA Customer until that entity is approved to be a PTA Customer, has executed the applicable PTA Agreement for the proposed PTA Program in a form acceptable to the Corporation, and has paid all associated fees and other costs. Prior to commencing each PTA Program, a PTA Customer must enter into a PTA Agreement with the Corporation for each PTA Program.

An entity may be a Principal for Payment Transfer Activity and an Affiliate for another Activity, or vice versa. An entity applying to Participate as a Principal in Payment Transfer Activity(ies) and that is Participating in another Activity as an Affiliate, must have obtained the express written consent of its Sponsor.

The decision to approve an applicant as a PTA Customer (including, admission of such PTA Customer as an Originating Institution and/or Receiving Customer) is at the discretion of the Corporation.

The eligibility criteria for a PTA Customer includes:

1. As applicable, compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) or other standards related to securing and protecting data as specified in the Standards applicable to a particular PTA Program or as mutually agreed in writing by the PTA Customer and the Corporation for such PTA Program;
2. Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations for each jurisdiction in which the PTA Program is proposed to be conducted;
3. Compliance with all applicable PTA Rules and Standards; and
4. Such other criteria as the Corporation deems necessary or appropriate to safeguard the safety and security of the Corporation and Payment Transfer Activity.

## Anti-Money Laundering Requirements

Each Customer conducting or proposing to conduct Activity must have a written AML compliance Program with a policy, procedures, and controls in place to safeguard the Corporation and the Interchange System from and against the use of the Interchange System for money laundering and/or terrorist financing. Each Customer’s AML compliance Program must be commensurate with its respective AML risk profile and fully implemented in accordance with this Rule and local regulatory requirements.

A Customer’s AML compliance Program must address, in a manner satisfactory to the Corporation, all Activity and include, at a minimum, the following:

1. A process to ensure thorough client identification and due diligence;
2. Sufficient controls, resources, and monitoring systems for the prompt detection and reporting of suspicious activity, including the requirements set forth in Rule 1.2.1.1;
3. Compliance with all regulatory record-keeping and reporting requirements;
4. Risk assessment processes designed to identify and apply appropriate risk management controls;
5. A training program for all personnel whose duties require knowledge of the AML compliance Program and requirements; and

## Transfer of Cards to India Residents is Prohibited without a License

An Issuer that reasonably believes that its Cardholders will distribute, transfer, or in any way provide Cards issued by the Issuer to residents of India must become Licensed in India and receive written authorization from the Reserve Bank of India.

Unless the Issuer is Licensed in India and has written authorization from the Reserve Bank of India, an Issuer that issues Cards to Cardholders that reside outside of India must communicate to those Cardholders in the terms and conditions of the cardholder agreement that such Cards must not be distributed, transferred, or in any way provided to residents of India.

## Changing Customer Status

In the event that an Affiliate wishes to become a Principal or a Principal wishes to become an Affiliate, the Customer must notify the Corporation and submit such information as the Corporation deems necessary.

It is within the Corporation’s discretion whether to grant the requested change in Customer status.

## Customer Name Change

The Corporation must receive written notice at least 30 days before the effective date of any proposed Customer name change.

A Customer that proposes to change its name must promptly undertake necessary or appropriate action to ensure that its Licenses and Activities disclose the Customer’s updated name.

## Portfolio Sale, Transfer, or Withdrawal

The Corporation must receive written notice at least 30 days before the effective date of any proposed transfer or assignment of a Mastercard Portfolio.

A Customer must promptly provide the Corporation any information requested by the Corporation relating to such an event or proposed event. If such transfer or assignment will result in a change of Control of the Customer or the Customer’s issuing Program, acquiring Program, or both, then Rule 1.12 shall apply.

A Principal must not withdraw a Maestro or Cirrus Portfolio from participation in the Interchange System except upon fulfillment of the following conditions:

1. The Principal must provide the Corporation with at least six months prior written notice of its intent to withdraw a Portfolio. If confidential negotiations surrounding a Portfolio sale would render six months’ notice unduly disruptive, the Corporation may accept a shorter time at its discretion.
2. The Principal must certify in writing to the Corporation that as of the date of withdrawal, no Cards will be in circulation, unless the Corporation has approved a plan for the phased withdrawal of the Portfolio. Any phased withdrawal must not exceed the lesser of one full re-issuance cycle or two years. Any withdrawal plan must guarantee that Cards still in circulation will continue to provide access to Accounts through the Corporation.
3. If there is a new owner of the Portfolio, such owner must be a Customer of the Corporation. Alternatively, if the new owner is not eligible to be Licensed, then it must enter into an agreement with the Corporation to be bound by all Rules applicable to the Portfolio during its withdrawal period.

## Payment Transfer Activity Variation

The Rule on this subject, as it applies to Payment Transfer Activity, is revised and restated as follows:

The Corporation must receive written notice at least 30 days before the effective date of any PTA Customer’s proposed transfer or assignment of its obligations under the Standards applicable to its Participation in Payment Transfer Activity. A Customer must promptly provide the Corporation any information requested by the Corporation relating to such an event or proposed event. If such transfer or assignment will result in a change of Control of the Customer, then Rule 1.12 shall apply.

# Termination

The Participation or Licenses or Digital Activity Agreements or PTA Agreements of a Customer may terminate in either of two ways: voluntary termination, or termination by the Corporation.

## Voluntary Termination

A Customer may voluntarily terminate its Participation and/or Licenses and/or Digital Activity Agreements and/or PTA Agreements by providing written notice and submitting documentation as then required by the Corporation. The notice must fix a date on which the termination will be effective as follows:
